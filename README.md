JAVA Project in Software Engineering 👩🏻‍💻
We created a computer-generated 3D environment using Java,
where we combined realistic physics simulations. 
This was accomplished by employing key concepts from software
engineering, such as agile methodologies, object-oriented
programming (OOP), and design patterns.
